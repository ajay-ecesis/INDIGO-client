Persistent cookies are stored on your device and are not deleted when the browser is closed - these cookies must be 'manually' deleted if you want to remove them. <br/>To learn more about cookies, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org or www.youronlinechoices.eu. <br/><br/>First and third party cookies <br/>We set cookies (first party cookies) on the Site, however, where we require additional information or services, we may also allow other companies to host cookies on our Site (third party cookies).

These include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of the Site and cookies that help us to debug any errors. If these cookies are blocked or disabled, some of the Site’s functions will not be available to you and you may not be able to use our service. <br/>Performance cookies - these cookies are used to obtain statistics about the number of users of the Site and how such users interact with the Site. These cookies collect information that is aggregated and therefore cannot be used to identify an individual's identity. Such information allows us to continuously improve the Site to provide users with a better online experience (such as enabling users to find what they are looking for more easily). <br/>Functionality cookies - these cookies are used to improve the functionality of the Site and make it easier to use. They help us to identify you as a repeat user of the Site and help us remember your preferences, which saves you time by making the user experience easier. <br/>Analytical - these cookies gather information about your habits when using the Site (including the pages you have visited).

You should access the ‘Help’ function on your browser to learn how to do this. However, if you select this setting, you may be unable to access certain parts of the Site or discover that you have a reduced functionality whilst using the Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to the Site. <br/><br/>Please be aware that our advertisers may also use cookies. Advertisers’ use of cookies is not under our control and is therefore not subject to this Privacy & Cookies Policy. <br/><br/></p>
